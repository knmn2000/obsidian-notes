Util
- from internal/users endpoint, we should attach auth0id to the request

in wework website
- call ecom to get/reset wifi creds
- directly call global for printing

replacing auth middlewares with package
- global
	- why is auth0 stuff not working?
	- find a valid curl, test before and after
	- why was print job not working?
	- there are so many places where we are using authToken, will that be replaced by service token? 

rename utilities package to auth package
integrate auth package to the services 


test omnilogin login 
- login to auth0 multiple times. 
- login to auth0 via google multiple times
- refactor if possible
