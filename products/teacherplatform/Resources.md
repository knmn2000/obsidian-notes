after entering the link, we need to show a screen where we show how we have organized their video.
issue:

its possible they have taught one topic across multiple playlists. 
its possible they have added all topics of one thing in one playlist.

here is the component structure. the component is supposed to hold the entire course. 
the accordion opened will contain the playlists that contain the content related to the course. 

WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT COURSES ARE A COLLECTION OF PLAYLISTS RELATED TO THE TOPIC

We need to have a create course button. which create the course component. 
under the component, we need to have add playlist button (with an indication that it will not affect youtube).
we should either have a search component (which will search through their videos only), or we should be able to get array of youtube links as an input. 

OR

we can ask the user to create a playlist on youtube, and it will show up here.

Note that this course creation screen should always be accessible to the teacher, even after creation.

this playlist component that opens in the accordion has to be generic. 
because we want the user to be able to create "playlists" (does not affect youtube structure)
