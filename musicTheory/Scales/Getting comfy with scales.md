Pick one key, eg. Cmaj/Ionian, Play the ionian shape and fit all the chords of the key in that one shape using traids

then play other modes without changing the key, like play C dorian for a while, get the vibe of the scale, uske baad play C phrygian and get the vibe, Then experiment with chord triads of those modes, play around with building tension using notes like B in the key of C and resolve it back to C, Dominant and secondary dominant chords ke triads nikalo, tension build kro and unko bhi resolve kro fir root pe

mess around a bit on a C maj backing track, pick a few notes and find as many permutation and combinations that you can play using just 4 notes but by changing the rythm pattern, then expand it further

towards the rest of the scale.

Har shape ke notes memorise krlo fretboard par, after a while ho jayega, then it'll be easier to just switch around the chords of that scale throughout the fretboard using triads

And triads ke notes yaad krlo ek key me, uske baad you just have to play the same shapes/patterns transpose krke to play in other keys

master one key, apply the same to other keys
