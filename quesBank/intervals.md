### **Problem Statement**

You are given a sorted list of non-overlapping intervals (e.g., `[[1,3], [6,9], [12,16]]`). Each interval is represented as `[start, end]`, where `start <= end`. You are also given a new interval (e.g., `[4,8]`) that you need to **insert** into the list, maintaining the sorted order of intervals. If necessary, **merge** any intervals that overlap with the new interval. Return the resulting list of intervals.

Formally:

1. You have an array `intervals`, sorted by the start of each interval in **ascending** order.
2. You have a new interval `newInterval`.
3. **Insert** `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` remains sorted and **non-overlapping**.
4. If the newly inserted interval overlaps with one or more existing intervals, **merge** them into a single interval.

**Example**

- Input: `intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]]`, `newInterval = [2,5]`
- Output: `[[1,5],[6,9]]`
    - Here, `[2,5]` overlaps with `[1,3]`, so they merge into `[1,5]`.

### **Why This Problem Tests Corner Cases**

1. **Intervals might merge with one or multiple existing intervals.**
2. **Insertion at the extreme ends** of the list (before the first interval or after the last).
3. **New interval could be fully contained** within an existing interval or vice versa.
4. **Empty list** of existing intervals.
5. **Intervals with same start and end** (e.g., `[5,5]`) or zero-length intervals (e.g., `[2,2]`).
6. **Overlapping boundaries** (e.g., new interval starts exactly where another interval ends).

These scenarios force careful handling of index boundaries, start/end comparisons, and merging logic.

### **Detailed Requirements**

1. **Input/Output Format**
    
    - **Input**:
        - `intervals`: A list of non-overlapping intervals sorted by ascending `start`.
        - `newInterval`: The interval to insert.
    - **Output**:
        - A new list of non-overlapping intervals in sorted order, reflecting the insertion (and merging if necessary).
2. **Constraints**
    
    - `intervals[i] = [start, end]` with `start <= end`.
    - The size of `intervals` can be from 0 to `n`, where `n` could be large.
    - `newInterval = [newStart, newEnd]` with `newStart <= newEnd`.
    - The intervals themselves might overlap with `newInterval` in complex ways.
3. **Corner Cases to Consider**
    
    - **Case A**: `intervals` is empty (insert the new interval as the only interval).
    - **Case B**: `newInterval` does not overlap with any existing intervals:
        - Strictly before all intervals (e.g., `newInterval` ends before `intervals[0]` starts).
        - Strictly after all intervals (e.g., `newInterval` starts after `intervals[n-1]` ends).
    - **Case C**: `newInterval` partially overlaps with exactly one interval.
    - **Case D**: `newInterval` overlaps with multiple intervals.
    - **Case E**: `newInterval` is completely contained within an existing interval (or vice versa).
    - **Case F**: `newInterval` has zero length (e.g., `[5,5]`).
    - **Case G**: Boundaries that “just touch” existing intervals (e.g., an interval ends at 10 and the new one starts at 10). Decide if touching intervals should merge or remain separate. (Typically, `[a, b]` and `[b, c]` are considered **not** overlapping in standard interval problems, but clarify your requirement if they should merge.)

### **Sample Test Cases**

1. **Basic Overlap**
    
    - `intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]]`, `newInterval = [2,5]`
    - **Expected output**: `[[1,5],[6,9]]`
2. **Insertion at the Beginning**
    
    - `intervals = [[5,7],[9,11]]`, `newInterval = [1,3]`
    - **Expected output**: `[[1,3],[5,7],[9,11]]`
        - No overlap, just prepend.
3. **Insertion at the End**
    
    - `intervals = [[1,2],[3,4]]`, `newInterval = [5,6]`
    - **Expected output**: `[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]`
        - No overlap, just append.
4. **Overlapping Multiple Intervals**
    
    - `intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]]`, `newInterval = [4,9]`
    - **Expected output**: `[[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]`
        - `[4,9]` overlaps `[3,5]`, `[6,7]`, and `[8,10]`.
5. **Fully Containing an Existing Interval**
    
    - `intervals = [[2,4],[7,8]]`, `newInterval = [1,10]`
    - **Expected output**: `[[1,10]]`
        - The new interval swallows all existing intervals.
6. **Empty Initial List**
    
    - `intervals = []`, `newInterval = [2,5]`
    - **Expected output**: `[[2,5]]`
7. **Touching Boundaries**
    
    - `intervals = [[1,2],[3,4]]`, `newInterval = [2,3]`
    - Depending on your definition, do `[1,2]` and `[2,3]` merge? If your rule is that an interval ends at 2 and another starts at 2 are **not** overlapping, the answer is `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]`.
    - If you consider intervals that share a boundary as overlapping, then it would merge into `[[1,4]]`.
    - **Clarify which behavior you want** during the interview.

### **Possible Approaches**

1. **Iterative Approach**
    
    - Traverse `intervals` while the new interval should come after the current interval (i.e., `currentInterval.end < newInterval.start`).
    - Insert intervals that appear strictly before the new interval into the result.
    - Merge overlapping intervals by comparing starts and ends.
    - Insert the merged interval.
    - Append any remaining intervals.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of existing intervals.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the output list.
2. **Binary Search Variant**
    
    - Since the intervals are sorted, you can try to **binary search** for the insertion position by `start`.
    - Then merge as needed.
    - This can potentially reduce the finding of the “start” position to O(log n), but merging and shifting intervals might still be O(n) overall.

### **Why It’s a Good Interview Question**

- **Sorting & In-place Thinking**: You have sorted intervals, so you can leverage that ordering to make an efficient pass.
- **Merging Logic**: You must carefully compare boundaries to decide whether to merge intervals or keep them separate.
- **Corner Cases**: The question forces the candidate to think about a broad range of scenarios (empty list, nested intervals, partial overlaps, boundary touches, etc.).
- **Implementation Detail**: Requires careful indexing, condition checks, and combining intervals.
- **Time Complexity & Optimization**: Discussing the naive solution vs. a more optimized approach (e.g., partial binary search) can show depth of understanding.

**In an interview**, ask the candidate to:

1. **Walk through** their logic on multiple corner cases.
2. **Justify** their time/space complexity.
3. **Explain** how they handle boundary conditions like `[2,2]` or intervals touching at the boundaries.

This problem’s complexity and array of edge conditions make it a solid test for a candidate’s **data structures and algorithm** skills, especially their ability to handle tricky corner cases.
