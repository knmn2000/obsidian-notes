Reasoned about task scheduler challenge for 7 seconds

**Balancing simplicity and concurrency**

I'm proposing a clear balance between concurrency and simplicity, like a "multi-level cache" or "Thread-safe LRU cache," to effectively test the candidate's backend development skills.

**Crafting a challenging task**

Engaging with a rate limiter or LRU cache ensures effective testing of the candidate's concurrency and data structure knowledge, aligning well with their experience level.

**Medium-Level Machine Coding Challenge: Basic API Rate Limiter**

Below is a practical backend coding challenge at a **medium** level of difficulty. It’s common for backend developers with around 2–3 years of experience. This challenge tests:

- **Concurrency control**
- **Simple data structure design**
- **Handling real-world scenarios** (API calls, user-based limits, etc.)
- **Clean, maintainable code**

---

## 1. **Scenario**

You need to implement a **Rate Limiter** for a web service. The service wants to limit how many requests a given user can make within a **time window**.

For example, **each user** can make at most **N requests** in a **rolling 1-minute window**. If a user exceeds that limit, further requests should be **rejected** (or throttled) until their usage falls below the limit again.

### **Example**

- Suppose `N = 5` requests per minute for each user.
- If a user sends 5 requests in quick succession, all 5 succeed. A 6th request within the same 60-second window should be **rejected** with a `429 Too Many Requests` error (or similar).
- After enough time passes so that the user is only within 4 requests in the last minute, the next request can succeed again.

---

## 2. **Requirements**

### **Functional Requirements**

1. **Tracking Requests Per User**
    
    - Each user (identified by a `userId` or an API key) has a **fixed** request quota (e.g., `N = 5` in a 60-second window).
    - You can store usage in an **in-memory** data structure.
2. **API/Method to Check Rate Limit**
    
    - You could implement an endpoint like `GET /limitCheck?userId=<userId>` which:
        - **Returns** whether the request should be allowed.
        - Optionally, you can just show an approach for intercepting requests in a real server environment (like a middleware).
3. **Rolling Window Behavior**
    
    - The rate limit is a **sliding** or **rolling** window. That is, for any new request at time `t`, you only count the requests that happened in the **last 60 seconds** (from `t - 60s` to `t`).
    - If the request count in that window is at or above `N`, **reject** the request. Otherwise, **allow** it and record it.
4. **Concurrency**
    
    - Multiple threads (or multiple requests arriving concurrently) might check/update usage data for the same or different users.
    - Ensure that **race conditions** do not allow a user to exceed their limit.
5. **Performance**
    
    - The data structure should be efficient enough to handle typical request volumes. For a medium-level solution, you can keep it simple and in-memory.
6. **Extendability** (Optional)
    
    - In a real scenario, you might want to handle different rate limits for different endpoints or user tiers.
    - But for this challenge, focusing on a **single** global limit per user is sufficient.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Thread-Safe** updates to the user’s request history or counters.
- **Time Complexity**: Each check should not degrade significantly with the number of requests. (Typically O(log M) or O(1), where M is the number of requests recorded within the time window per user.)
- **Clear Code**: The interviewer will likely assess your coding style, testing approach, and how you structure your logic.

---

## 3. **Possible Approaches**

1. **Sliding Window with Timestamp Queue**
    
    - Maintain a **queue (FIFO)** of timestamps (in milliseconds or seconds) for each user.
    - When a new request arrives:
        1. Remove timestamps from the front of the queue that are **older** than 60 seconds from the current time.
        2. Check the size of the queue; if it’s >= `N`, reject the request. Otherwise, add the new request’s timestamp to the queue and allow it.
    - **Time Complexity**: Each check is O(1) amortized if you remove old timestamps in a loop.
    - **Thread-Safety**: Use concurrency-safe data structures (e.g., synchronized queue or locks around the queue).
2. **Fixed Window (Simpler but Less Accurate)**
    
    - Keep a counter and a timestamp for each user that resets every 60 seconds.
    - This is simpler but can create **edge-case bursts** around boundary times. (Not a perfect “rolling” or “sliding” window.)
3. **Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket**
    
    - Maintain a “bucket” of tokens that refills at a steady rate (e.g., 5 tokens per 60 seconds) for each user.
    - Each request consumes a token. If no tokens are available, the request is rejected.
    - This is conceptually more advanced but widely used. For a medium-level question, either the **Queue** or **Bucket** approach is fine.

## 4. **Data Structures & Concurrency**

1. **In-Memory Store**
    
    - A `HashMap<userId, Data>` where `Data` holds:
        - A queue/list of timestamps, OR
        - A count and lastResetTime (for fixed window), OR
        - A token count and the last timestamp tokens were added (for token bucket).
2. **Synchronization**
    
    - Either use a **global lock** whenever updating a user’s data or a **per-user lock** to reduce contention.
    - Alternatively, you can use concurrency-safe structures or atomic operations if implementing a token bucket approach.
3. **Cleanup** (Optional)
    
    - If many users appear and never return, your structure might grow.
    - You could remove user entries after some idle time (not strictly required for the basic solution).

---

## 5. **Endpoints & Example Requests**

1. **Check (or Make) a Request**
    
    - `GET /limitCheck?userId=123`
    - **Response**:
        
        json
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `{   "userId": 123,   "allowed": true,   "remainingQuota": 2 }`
        
    - If limit is exceeded:
        
        json
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `{   "userId": 123,   "allowed": false,   "reason": "Rate limit exceeded" }`
        
2. **Configuration** (Optional)
    
    - `POST /config?userId=123&limit=10`
    - If you want to dynamically set different limits for different users. This is an extension, not mandatory.

---

## 6. **Edge Cases to Consider**

1. **Multiple Requests at the Same Exact Time**
    
    - If two requests come in for the same user concurrently, your concurrency control must ensure the user doesn’t exceed the limit.
2. **User Not Found**
    
    - The first time you see a user, you may need to initialize their usage tracking.
3. **Time Window Boundaries**
    
    - Make sure requests exactly at the 60-second boundary get handled correctly (e.g., if a request at time `t0` is considered expired at `t0 + 60`).
4. **System Clock**
    
    - Use a consistent method to get the current time (e.g., `System.currentTimeMillis()` or a monotonic clock).
    - Watch out for clock drift if you rely on external time sources.
5. **High Traffic**
    
    - If many requests come in, your approach should handle them efficiently without huge memory overhead or slow lookups.

---

## 7. **What the Interviewer Looks For**

1. **Correctness**
    
    - Does your solution correctly allow or reject requests according to the rate limit?
2. **Clarity & Maintainability**
    
    - Is the code well-structured (classes, methods, naming)?
3. **Concurrency Approach**
    
    - Do you properly synchronize shared data structures?
    - Any obvious race conditions?
4. **Performance**
    
    - Is the algorithm efficient for typical usage (sliding window approach is usually O(1) amortized per check)?
5. **Extensibility**
    
    - Can we easily adjust the time window or the limit `N`?
    - Could we add per-endpoint or per-API-key logic?
6. **Testing & Edge Cases**
    
    - Do you demonstrate tests for boundary conditions and concurrent requests?

### **Conclusion**

This **medium-level** machine coding problem is great for a **2–3 year** backend developer. It requires:

- **Basic concurrency** (locks or thread-safe structures).
- **Simple algorithmic approach** (queues, counters, or token buckets).
- **Clean code** that integrates with an API layer (if you choose to implement an HTTP interface).

It’s neither too trivial (just a CRUD) nor too advanced (heavy distributed system). It effectively checks if the candidate knows how to **implement a common backend feature** that deals with concurrency and time-based logic.
