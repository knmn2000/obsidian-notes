Note: There are 2 types of consistencies #read 
		- One in CAP theorem, and one in ACID.
		- We are concerned with the CAP theorem consistency
		- What is the difference?

In the context of distributed systems, consistency in the CAP theorem refers to a system's ability to provide consistent data across all nodes in the network. The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, it is impossible to simultaneously achieve all three of the following guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.

Consistency in ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) refers to ensuring that transactions are processed accurately and reliably according to predefined rules or constraints within a single database.

The key difference between these two types of consistencies lies in their scope:
- In CAP theorem consistency: It focuses on maintaining consistency across multiple nodes or replicas in a distributed system despite potential network partitions.
- In ACID consistency: It pertains to maintaining transactional integrity within a single database instance.

While both types of consistencies aim for data correctness and reliability, they operate at different levels - one at the distributed system level (CAP) and the other at the individual database level (ACID).
